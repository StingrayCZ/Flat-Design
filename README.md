# Proposal locations of forniture
This project is origin from 2011 when I have fly away from my maternity nest and find own little kingdom with my throne. Incidentally, I acquired one three room old apartment in one of suburbs. By quote "Beggars can't be choosers" I had a flat but with a totally smashed interior. Before some plannig reconstruction I had to scrapt or sold ancient forniture and other equipment. There is also healt risk due to mothball (naphthalene insect repellent) contamination of the wood from forniture. Today that is considered as dangerous carcinogen.

So I literally started on a brownfield land. The task was rebuilt old flat for four member family into flat with three  rooms for young students. By this fact, every rooms have beds, chairs, wardrobe and other requirements for living. For my CAD modeling practice I made a non importaint model of WC.
