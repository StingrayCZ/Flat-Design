# Proposal locations of forniture
This project is origin from 2011 when I have fly away from my maternity nest and filled my dreams about a little kingdom with my throne. Incidentally, I acquired a old three room apartment in one of suburbs. By quote "beggars can't be choosers" I had a big flat but on the other hand with totally smashed interior. Before some plannig reconstruction I had to scrapt or sell ancient forniture and other equipment. There is also healt risk due to mothball (naphthalene insect repellent) contamination of the wood from forniture. Today that is considered as dangerous carcinogen.

I literally started on a brownfield land. The main task was rebuilt old flat for four member family into flat with three independentaly rooms for young students. I was absolutely untouched by architecture thingking or design apartment. First of all I slinked on the floor with a tape measure and find out all of length nad matches of each rooms. I measured WC room as well.  After heaped up every dimensions I made model of my flat in SolidWorks. Afterwards I visited several shops with forniture, spend many times with catalogues about design. The prime detail for making decisions was the cost. Choosed pieces I carried forward to 3D models. And this is result...
