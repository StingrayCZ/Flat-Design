# Flat-Design
This project is origin from 2011 when I was thinking about organization of my new flat. The task was rebuilt old flat for four member family into flat with three  rooms for young students. By this fact, every rooms have beds, chairs, wardrobe and other requirements for living. For my CAD modeling practice I made a model of WC.
