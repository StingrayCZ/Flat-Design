# Proposal locations of forniture
This project is origin from 2011 when I was thinking about organization of forniture and any features in rented flat. The task was rebuilt old flat for four member family into flat with three  rooms for young students. By this fact, every rooms have beds, chairs, wardrobe and other requirements for living. For my CAD modeling practice I made a non importaint model of WC.
