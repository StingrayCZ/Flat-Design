# Proposal of my apartment (furniture placement)
This project is originated from 2011 when I flew away from my maternity nest and fulfilled my dreams about a little kingdom with my throne. Incidentally, I acquired a old three room apartment in one of suburbs. By quote "beggars can't be choosers" I had a big flat but on the other hand with totally smashed interior. Before even plannig reconstruction I had to scrap or sell ancient furniture and other equipment. There was also a health risk due to contamination of the wooden furniture by mothball (naphthalene insect repellent). Today that is considered as a dangerous carcinogen.

I literally started on a brownfield land. The main task was rebuilt a old flat for four member family into a flat with three independentaly rooms for young students. I was absolutely untouched by architecture thingking or methology how to make own design. First of all I was slinking on the floor with a tape measure and find out all of lengths and widths of each rooms. I measured a WC room as well.  After heaped up all dimensions I made a CAD model of my flat in SolidWorks. Afterwards I visited several shops with furniture, spend much time with catalogues about design. The prime detail for making decisions was the cost. Choosed pieces I carried forward to 3D models. 

Sometimes I had a problem to find a reliable mass produced furniture. And I had to make own design. Fox example a wardrobe and unusal narrow beside tables.
